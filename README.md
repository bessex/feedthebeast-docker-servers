# Dockerized FTB Minecraft servers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bessex/feedthebeast-docker-servers.svg?branch=testing)](https://travis-ci.com/github/bessex/feedthebeast-docker-servers)

## This repository is up for adoption!
If you are willing to adopt this project, please fork this repository and do so.
Please contact me, for adding you to the Docker Hub project.

## Description

So, you want to run your own FTB Minecraft Server? Use these Docker images to do so!

To use this, you will need some knowledge on how to use Docker.
Please read about docker here: https://docs.docker.com/learn/

Pull the docker images from
https://hub.docker.com/u/feedthebeast/

## Usage

TL;DR; `docker run -it feedthebeast/direwolf20`

The images are all hosted on Docker hub under the organization feedthebeast
and the repositories all have names mapping to their real mod pack name.

## Volumes

To make sure that you keep the world and McMyAdmin backups I recommend you
to use docker volumes to mount specific folders on your host machine into
the container. On my personal server I've done this:
```bash
mkdir -p /var/lib/minecraft/{world,backups}
docker run \
  -v /var/lib/minecraft/world:/opt/minecraft/world \
  -v /var/lib/minecraft/backups:/home/minecraft/mcmyadmin/Backups \
  --name minecraft \
  feedthebeast/beyond
```

This is if you leave the `LEVEL_NAME` variable with the default value `world`
Changing the `LEVEL_NAME` variable, you need to also change the name of the
containers world directory accordingly.

## Ports

There are three important ports that you will want to communicate with
when you're starting your server.

- 8080: This is the port for communicating with McMyAdmin
- 8123: The port DynMap listens to
- 25565: Standars Minecraft port

These ports are all exposed in the Dockerfile when building the images,
but for you to be able to communicate with them, you will need to 
publish them as well.
Use either eg `-p8080:8080` to publish the port 8080 or use `--net host`
to make all ports published directly on the host machine.

examples:
```bash
docker run -p8080:8080 -p25565:25565 -p8123:8123 feedthebeast/infinity
```
or
```bash
docker run --net host feedthebeast/infinity
```

## Versioning
The `latest` tag might not always be correct, just so that is said.

Version tags in the docker repo should always be MCV_MPV where MCV is the
Minecraft version, and MPV is the mod pack version.
So say you want direwolf20's pack version 1.5.1 for minecraft 1.10
you should then run the command
`docker run -it feedthebeast/direwolf20:1.10_1.5.1`

## Configuration

You can config the server.properties file using these environment variables:

| Variable | default value |
| --- | --- |
| MAX_TICK_TIME | 60000Â |
| GENERATOR_SETTINGS |  |
| FORCE_GAMEMODE | false |
| ALLOW_NETHER | true |
| GAMEMODE | 0 |
| ENABLE_QUERY | false |
| PLAYER_IDLE_TIMEOUT | 0 |
| DIFFICULTY | 1 |
| SPAWN_MONSTERS | true |
| OP_PERMISSION_LEVEL | 4 |
| ANNOUNCE_PLAYER_ACHIEVEMENT | true |
| PVP | true |
| SNOOPER_ENABLED | true |
| LEVEL_TYPE | DEFAULT |
| HARDCORE | false |
| ENABLE_COMMAND_BLOCK | false |
| MAX_PLAYERS | 20 |
| NETWORK_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD | 256 |
| RESOURCE_PACK_SHA1 |  |
| MAX_WORLD_SIZE | 29999984 |
| SERVER_PORT | 25565 |
| SERVER_IP |  |
| SPAWN_NPCS | true |
| ALLOW_FLIGHT | false |
| LEVEL_NAME | world |
| VIEW_DISTANCE | 10 |
| RESOURCE_PACK |  |
| SPAWN_ANIMALS | true |
| WHITE_LIST_ENABLED | false |
| GENERATE_STRUCTURES | true |
| ONLINE_MODE | true |
| MAX_BUILD_HEIGHT | 256 |
| LEVEL_SEED |  |
| USE_NATIVE_TRANSPORT | true |
| ENABLE_RCON | false |

Say you want to create a server with the level seed "mylevelseed", then you use this command:
`docker run -it -e LEVEL_SEED="mylevelseed" feedthebeast/direwolf20`

Read more about environment variables in docker here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#/set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file

## McMyAdmin

Default login is `admin:pass123`

Right now this login will be reset if the container is restarted, due to the way
the feedthebeast/ftbbase image is built now.
I will try to rethink this.

# Pull requests and Issues are welcome!

Please feel free to create pull requests and write about your issues here on GitHub.
Though, if you are having trouble using docker or something is wrong with the modpack,
please either read the docker documentation or refer to the mod pack author(s).

# The credit goes to!

Whoever works on building the mod packs!

I, artheus, only make them more available for the users who wants to host their own servers.
